## My process

I used Codepen to quickly prototype the design and then exported it to finalize the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Codepen
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I haven't worked with Flexbox containers before so it was a learning process. After figuring out how to work with it, it became a simple process of piecing it all together and recreating the design.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - This helped me get the hang of flexbox containers and taught me how to use them properly.
